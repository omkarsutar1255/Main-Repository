# numpy stands for numerical python.

# numpy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional python lists.

# numpy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists,
# so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
# this behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.
