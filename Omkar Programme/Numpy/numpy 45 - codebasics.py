# numpy advantages compared to list:
# 1) numpy is use less memory to store data
# 2) numpy is faster than list
# 3) numpy is more convenient than list for like mathematical process, etc

# arr1.itemsize        will give size of each element in array
# ravel                this will flatten multidimensional array into one dimensional array
# np.std               this will give standard deviation of array
# arr1[0:2,2]          this will retrieve row 0 and row 1 value corresponding to column 2
# vstack               this will put second array after first array
# hstack               this allows to put second array at side of first array
