UCL    - we can take machine learning data from this website
There are many types of machine learning model :
1) Supervised machine learning : machine knows the feature
    1) Classification - classify which label a given set of features belong to.
       ex. = if we give machine apple, banana, mango and set what fruit is what then next time when we give image of
             fruit to machine it will check features of it and give label of that fruit that is apple or mango or banana
    2) Regression - Find out the value of the label using previous data.
       ex. = if we give data of homes with their area, window and price then next time when we give area and window of
             some home then machine will tell its price
2) Unsupervised machine learning : Machine seeing data for the first time
    1) Clustering - Discover the inherent grouping in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior
    2) Association - Association rule learning problem, such as people that buy X also trend to buy Y.

Training and test data in machine learning
Total data is divided into training data and test data
Training data - to prepare machine learning model first feed some data that is maybe half of total data
Test data - remaining data is feed to machine model without end result and after machine give end result of that data
            we check that with original end result hence if both results are almost same then machien learning model is
            successful.

Simple Linear Regression - predicting label on the bases of only one type features
1) Setting features and label in ascending order on a graph
2) Draw one straight line for all intersecting points with minimum error(distance from line to point) and on that line
   we can predict label by giving features only
3) here SST is sum of squares of errors

Multiple Linear Regression
1) It takes multiple types of features to predict label pricing in machine learning
2) f(X1, X2,..., Xn) = Wo, W1X1, W2X2,.., WnXn. here X1 - Xn are the types of features and W1 - Wn are prediction
